## Part 1: Competitive Intelligence

### How Competitors Found Success

#### Hometrack (Acquired by Zoopla for £120M)
- **Strategy:** Built credibility through accreditation (Moody's, S&P, Fitch ratings)
- **Key Win:** First AVM accredited by major ratings agencies
- **B2B Focus:** Targeted mortgage lenders directly - now used by 18 of top 20 UK lenders
- **Revenue Model:** 70%+ subscription-based, long-term contracts
- **Growth:** 15% CAGR from 2013-2016

#### Zoopla (Founded 2007)
- **Differentiation:** Data transparency when others just listed properties
- **Founder Strategy:** Alex Chesterman solved his own problem (compiling Land Registry data)
- **Funding:** VC-backed (Atlas Venture, Octopus) - but bootstrapped MVP first
- **Growth Tactic:** Acquisitions (PrimeLocation, FindaProperty, Globrix)

#### Rightmove (Dominant player)
- **Launch Strategy:** Founded by 4 major estate agencies = instant supply
- **Clever Move:** Free listings initially, charged from 2002 once established
- **First-Mover:** Launched 2000, had 6,000 agents (50% market) by 2004

### Lessons for Doorstep
1. **Credibility first** - Hometrack won through accreditation
2. **Solve a real problem** - Zoopla made data accessible
3. **Land anchor customers** - Rightmove had big agents from day 1
4. **Subscription > one-off** - Predictable revenue wins
